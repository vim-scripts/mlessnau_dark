This 256 color scheme is inspired by the color scheme used by railscasts.

It does work in 256-color terminals (export TERM=screen-256color) but results may differ when using it in gvim.

It is optimized for vimdiff, ruby, javascript, php, c/c++, sh and HTML. It has some tweaks for NERD_tree as well.

Enjoy :)
